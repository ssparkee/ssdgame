TODO:
* Make a script for the customer. This will have a random ice cream generated
  and will walk up to the store.
* Make a tutorial. It will be on a different scene and will be some dialogue 
  with like 2 customers that have predefined ice creams. This is how we get the 
  victory scene.
* Make it so if you mess up the order enough they will get fucking angy and kill you
* Add coins, pretty easy, just have the customer add 1 to the counter when you do an
  order good. Probably have like 2 coins already in it from the tutorial
* Add a title scene. Will be a seperate scene with a button to do tutorial and one to
  do main game.
* If you have time, set all the images and see if you can display a video on the screen.
  Also do the VHS filter. Also do voice lines

* Victory will display after doing the tutorial, as the main game can not be won.
* Loss will be when you die in main game and be pretty cursed.
